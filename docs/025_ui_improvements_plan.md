improvements to the apps/story-tree-ui
- the ui color is too dark. make it more delightful, the style should be more matching "children storybook". but keep the style professional.
    - use this color palette:
        - f0ead2 (page background, etc)
        - dde5b6
        - adc178
        - a98467
        - 6c584c
        - other compatible colors..
        - make the color palette part of the theme file so it's easy to swap.
- constitution markdwon render
    - right now it shows raw markdown text
- fix the layout of the story page
    - move story title to the side panel top. add a story thumbnail (the same as the image as in the story list page, the first shot's image)
        - home icon button to go back to story list page
        - thumbnail image on left, story title on right.
        - below the title area, is the navigation tabs
    - let the main canvas area take the full area. don't add the story title to the canvas area (the main working area)
    - remove the purple dot on the top right corner
    - side panel should be fix, do not scroll with the main area
- fix the side panel icons. use proper icon library
- fix the side panel text (a few words to say "why" this tab is important, don't like "raw json")
- fix the visual tab to fit the new data structure for characters and environments
    - it is broken now after we deprecate the use of visual reference package.
    - show characters with a single model sheet image and all metadata properly shown in ui element.
- story list page
    - for each story entry
        - left: story thumbnail image (the first shot's image), with proper size
        - right:
            - first row: bigger heavier font: story title
            - second row: find from the "logline" section from story constitution markdown, smaller lighter font.
        - remove the "purple dot" thing
