# story-workflow Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-agent-workflow-orchestrator. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Provide Agent Workflow Orchestrator
The backend MUST expose workflow factories that either create a new story from a prompt or resume an existing story and return a stateless workflow handle.

#### Scenario: Create workflow from prompt
- **GIVEN** a caller supplies a non-empty story prompt
- **WHEN** the workflow factory runs
- **THEN** it MUST create a new story row via the stories repository
- **AND** it MUST persist the prompt in the `initial_prompt` column
- **AND** it MUST return a workflow object containing the new story id.

#### Scenario: Resume workflow for existing story
- **GIVEN** a caller supplies an existing story id
- **WHEN** the workflow factory runs
- **THEN** it MUST fetch the story via the repository
- **AND** it MUST throw an error if the story is missing
- **AND** it MUST return a workflow object containing only the story id.

### Requirement: Persist Constitution Output
The workflow MUST capture the Gemini-generated constitution and align the story row with the proposed title when the `CREATE_CONSTITUTION` task runs.

#### Scenario: Constitution task saves artifacts
- **GIVEN** the constitution task runs for a story without a stored constitution
- **WHEN** Gemini returns `proposed_story_title` and `story_constitution_markdown`
- **THEN** the workflow MUST store the markdown in `stories.story_constitution`
- **AND** it MUST update the story `display_name` to the proposed title using the repository
- **AND** it MUST mark the task as completed so repeat invocations fail fast.

### Requirement: Trigger Interactive Story Generation
The workflow MUST populate scenelets when the `CREATE_INTERACTIVE_SCRIPT` task runs for a story that already has a constitution.

#### Scenario: Interactive script task generates scenelets
- **GIVEN** the story has a stored constitution and no prior interactive generation
- **WHEN** the interactive script task runs
- **THEN** it MUST invoke the interactive generator with the story id, constitution markdown, and injected scenelet persistence
- **AND** it MUST persist generated scenelets via the persistence interface
- **AND** it MUST surface generator failures to the caller
- **AND** it MUST mark the task as completed so repeat invocations fail fast.

### Requirement: Keep Orchestrator Testable
The workflow MUST separate business logic from IO so unit tests can run without real Supabase or Gemini dependencies for each task.

#### Scenario: Dependencies injected for tasks
- **GIVEN** tests supply fake repositories, constitution generator, and interactive generator
- **WHEN** any workflow task runs under test
- **THEN** it MUST rely solely on the injected dependencies
- **AND** it MUST avoid reading environment variables or instantiating real clients inside the business logic.

### Requirement: Task-Based Execution
The workflow MUST expose `runTask` and `runAllTasks` so callers can execute individual tasks or the full sequence.

#### Scenario: Run single task
- **GIVEN** a workflow handle and a task identifier
- **WHEN** `runTask` is invoked
- **THEN** it MUST validate task prerequisites using current repository state
- **AND** it MUST execute the matching task implementation
- **AND** it MUST throw an error if the task was already completed.

#### Scenario: Run all tasks sequentially
- **GIVEN** a workflow handle
- **WHEN** `runAllTasks` is invoked
- **THEN** it MUST execute the supported tasks in the defined order (constitution then interactive script)
- **AND** it MUST surface the final constitution metadata for compatibility with existing callers.
