## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Schedule Visual Design Task
The workflow MUST expose a `CREATE_VISUAL_DESIGN` task that runs after interactive script generation and persists the resulting visual design document.

#### Scenario: runAllTasks executes visual design after interactive script
- **GIVEN** a story with a stored constitution and generated interactive script scenelets
- **WHEN** `runAllTasks` executes
- **THEN** it MUST invoke the visual design task immediately after `CREATE_INTERACTIVE_SCRIPT`
- **AND** it MUST persist the Gemini response into `stories.visual_design_document`
- **AND** it MUST skip the task when `stories.visual_design_document` is already populated.

#### Scenario: visual design task validates prerequisites
- **GIVEN** a workflow handle
- **WHEN** `runTask('CREATE_VISUAL_DESIGN')` executes
- **THEN** it MUST throw an error if the story lacks a constitution, has no stored scenelets, or already has a visual design document
- **AND** when prerequisites pass it MUST load the constitution, assemble the interactive script tree payload, call Gemini with the visual design system prompt, and persist the returned JSON via the stories repository.
