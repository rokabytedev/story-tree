## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Task-Based Execution
The workflow MUST expose `runTask` and `runAllTasks` so callers can execute individual tasks or the full sequence.

#### Scenario: Run single task
- **GIVEN** a workflow handle and a task identifier
- **WHEN** `runTask` is invoked
- **THEN** it MUST validate task prerequisites using current repository state
- **AND** it MUST execute the matching task implementation
- **AND** it MUST throw an error if the task was already completed.

#### Scenario: Run all tasks sequentially
- **GIVEN** a workflow handle
- **WHEN** `runAllTasks` is invoked
- **THEN** it MUST execute the supported tasks in the defined order (constitution, interactive script, visual design, visual reference, audio design, shot production)
- **AND** it MUST surface the final constitution metadata for compatibility with existing callers.

### Requirement: Schedule Audio Design Task
The workflow MUST expose an audio design task that runs after visual design generation and persists a validated audio design document.

#### Scenario: runAllTasks executes audio design after visual reference
- **GIVEN** a story with stored constitution, generated scenelets, a visual design document, and a visual reference package but no audio design document
- **WHEN** `runAllTasks` executes
- **THEN** it MUST invoke `CREATE_AUDIO_DESIGN` immediately after `CREATE_VISUAL_REFERENCE`
- **AND** it MUST persist the Gemini output into `stories.audio_design_document`
- **AND** it MUST skip the task when `stories.audio_design_document` is already populated.

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Schedule Visual Reference Task
The workflow MUST expose a `CREATE_VISUAL_REFERENCE` task that runs after visual design generation and persists the validated visual reference package.

#### Scenario: runAllTasks executes visual reference after visual design
- **GIVEN** a story with a stored constitution, generated scenelets, and a visual design document but no visual reference package
- **WHEN** `runAllTasks` executes
- **THEN** it MUST invoke `CREATE_VISUAL_REFERENCE` immediately after `CREATE_VISUAL_DESIGN`
- **AND** it MUST persist the validated package into `stories.visual_reference_package`
- **AND** it MUST skip the task when `stories.visual_reference_package` already contains data.

#### Scenario: visual reference task validates prerequisites
- **GIVEN** a workflow handle
- **WHEN** `runTask('CREATE_VISUAL_REFERENCE')` executes
- **THEN** it MUST throw a descriptive error if the story lacks a constitution, has no stored scenelets, lacks a visual design document, or already has a visual reference package
- **AND** when prerequisites pass it MUST load the constitution, assemble the story tree payload, call Gemini with the visual reference system prompt, validate the response, and persist the package via the stories repository.

### Requirement: Workflow CLI Exposes Visual Reference Task
The workflow CLI MUST allow operators to run the visual reference task explicitly or as part of the full pipeline in both stub and real Gemini modes.

#### Scenario: CLI runs visual reference task in stub mode
- **GIVEN** the CLI is invoked with `run-task --task CREATE_VISUAL_REFERENCE --mode stub`
- **WHEN** the visual reference fixtures are loaded
- **THEN** it MUST route the call to the workflow `CREATE_VISUAL_REFERENCE` task using the stub Gemini response
- **AND** it MUST print success output after persisting the generated visual reference package.

#### Scenario: CLI run-all includes visual reference
- **GIVEN** the CLI is invoked with `run-all --mode stub`
- **WHEN** constitution, interactive script, visual design, and visual reference fixtures are provided
- **THEN** the pipeline MUST include `CREATE_VISUAL_REFERENCE` after visual design and before audio design and complete without duplicating stored artifacts.
